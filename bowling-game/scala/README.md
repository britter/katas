# bowling-game-kata #

Scala implementation of the [bowling game kata by Uncle Bob](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata).
Each step is represented by one commit. The code is a one to one translation of the Java version of the kata and does
therefore not use any fancy Scala features.
